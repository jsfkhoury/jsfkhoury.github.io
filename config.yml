        üë®üèΩ‚Äçüíª I'm a Ph.D. candidate in Computer Science and Engineering with a focus on Cybersecurity at Louisiana State University (LSU).

        <br><br>
        üìö I conduct research in Cybersecurity, focusing on Internet-scale measurements to characterize and combat malicious activities. I also research and employ advanced machine learning techniques, such as Temporal Graph Neural Networks (TGNN), to detect Advanced Persistent Threats (APT) attacks. Additionally, I investigate vulnerabilities in source and binary code using Large Language Models (LLM) to enhance software security. I contribute to the development of cyber defense training materials and aim to bridge the gap between theory and practical application for the benefit of national security.
        <br><br>
        üéì Before coming to LSU, I was a Graduate Research Assistant at the Cyber Center for Security and Analytics (CCSA) at the University of Texas at San Antonio. I received a Bachelor‚Äôs degree from the Holy Spirit University of Kaslik (USEK) and a Master‚Äôs degree from the American University of Beirut (AUB), both in Computer Science.</div>"
