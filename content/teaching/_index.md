## Teaching

As part of my teaching service, I am redesigning my computer science and cybersecurity courses to provide active, student-centered, and hands-on learning experiences.

* **CSC 2362: Introduction to Cybersecurity and Cyberdefense** <br>
    *Session:* Fall '25 <br>
    *Description:* This course gives a clear, practical introduction to cybersecurity and aligns with the CompTIA Security+ (SY0-701) certification objectives. We cover core ideas such as confidentiality, integrity, availability, authentication, authorization, zero trust, change management, and basic cryptography. Students learn how to recognize common threats and vulnerabilities and how to reduce risk through access control, hardening, segmentation, and patching. We examine secure design in on-premises systems, cloud, virtualization, and the Internet of Things, and we study data protection, resilience, and recovery. We also cover secure operations, monitoring, vulnerability management, and incident response. The course introduces governance, risk, compliance, and user awareness. Recitations are delivered as labs powered by TryHackMe to build hands-on skills and prepare students for entry-level security roles.<br>

* **CSC 4351: Compiler Construction** <br>
    *Session:* Spring '25 <br>
